# HMT Test Task: User Service & Logging System

This repository contains a test implementation of a microservice architecture based on the HMT task.

## Overview

The solution consists of two primary components:

- **HMT_UserService** — a core service responsible for user management.
- **HMT.LogsService** — a separate service for centralized logging.

Additionally, a shared library **HMT.Foundation** is used to support common functionality such as data validation and inter-service communication models.
